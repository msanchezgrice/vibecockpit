# OpenAI API Migration Summary: Completions â†’ Responses

This document summarizes the migration process from OpenAI's Chat Completions API to the new Responses API.

## Migration Overview

The migration was completed in 5 phases, each building upon the previous one to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

### Phase 1: Core Library Update
- Updated the OpenAI client in `src/lib/openai.ts`
- Added `supportsResponsesApi()` helper function for feature detection
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
- Validated with a test script

### Phase 2: Task Draft Endpoint Migration
- Updated `src/pages/api/ai/tasks/[id]/draft.ts` to support Responses API format
- Maintained fallback to Chat Completions API for compatibility
- Updated response parsing logic for both API formats
- Tested endpoint with sample requests

### Phase 3: Launch Checklist Edge Function Migration
- Modified Supabase Edge Function in `supabase/functions/launch-checklist/index.ts`
- Implemented feature detection for Responses API
- Added automatic fallback to Chat Completions API
- Validated with local testing through Supabase CLI

### Phase 4: Model & Parameter Optimization
- Created benchmark script to compare APIs
- Documented optimal parameters for different use cases
- Mapped model names between APIs
- Provided detailed cost comparison

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Final Testing
- Created end-to-end test script to validate all functionality
- Ensured code quality and consistency across codebase
- Removed unnecessary compatibility code
- Performed full system testing

## API Differences Summary

| Feature | Chat Completions API | Responses API |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Input Format | Array of `messages` | Single `input` with optional `instructions` |
| Response Format | Nested in `choices[0].message` | Direct from top level `output_text` or `tool_calls` |
| Model Names | `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4-turbo` | `o3-mini`, `o3` |
| Tool Calling | `tool_calls` in nested message | `tool_calls` at top level |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type Safety**: The Responses API has different TypeScript types, which required careful handling to ensure type safety
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Feature detection via `supportsResponsesApi()` was crucial for a smooth transition
3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling was needed to gracefully fall back to the older API when needed
4. **Parameter Mapping**: Some parameters have different meanings or behave differently between APIs

## Future Recommendations

1. **Complete API Migration**: Once the Responses API is stable and all features are confirmed working, remove fallback code
2. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune prompts for the o3 models which have different capabilities than their predecessors
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continue monitoring performance differences between APIs
4. **Response Parsing**: Standardize the parsing of responses to handle both APIs transparently

- Local documentation in `docs/openai-model-params.md`
- Test scripts in `scripts/` directory

By following a phased approach with proper testing at each stage, we were able to successfully migrate to the new Responses API while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring continuous functionality.
